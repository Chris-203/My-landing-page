            <p>
              The app was developed using React, Next.js, JavaScript, MatureUI,
              Clerk and various libraries for barcode detection. We used the
              Open Food Facts API to retrieve product data and the
              barcode-detector library for barcode scanning using your native
              camera. The app is deployed on Vercel and hosted on our custom
              domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Toxiscan is a web application that uses the Open Food Facts API to
              provide information about food products regarding general
              information and their potential health risks and environmental
              impact. The app allows users to scan the barcode of a food item or
              search for it by name to view a detailed report. The report
              includes a product's ingredients, a nutrition score, a nova score,
              ingredient analysis, and a summary of the product's environmental
              impact. Users can also compare products and view recommendations
              for healthier alternatives.

              Professor API to retrieve professor data and the OpenAI API serves
              as a chatbot that retrieves the needed information from Pinecone.

              on the data from the RAG database created in Pinecone. retrieved
              from Rate My Professor. The chatbot uses the OpenAI API to
              generate responses and the Pinecone API to retrieve the needed
              information. We also created a scraping script that can take a
              rateMyProfessor link to scrape the site for the professor's or
              school's information which is then saved into the RAG database for
              general use for everyone.

            <h3>Personal Website</h3>
            <p>
              This website was created to showcase my projects and skills. It
              was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on
              responsive design. I used the Spectral template from HTML5 UP as a
              starting point and customized it to fit my needs. This project
              helped me improve my web development skills and learn how to use
              Git and GitHub for version control.

            <h3>Machine Translation Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This program was created for Professor Jonathan Gordon's
              Computational Linguistics class (CS366) as part of a final
              research paper. It provides a comparative analysis between direct
              translations (es-zh) and indirect translations (es-en-zh) using
              data from Tatoeba, an online community-built database of
              translations. We used transformers and HuggingFace libraries to
              select three models: one for direct translation and two for
              indirect translations. We fine-tuned these models with Tatoeba
              data and evaluated them using BLEU and ROUGE scoring metrics.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project tested my team's teamwork and communication skills,
              as well as my time-management and leadership abilities. While the
              final product yielded favorable results, with more time, we could
              further improve the model's accuracy.

            <h4>Vassar College Carpool App</h4>
            <p>
              This app was developed as a year-long project for Professor Rui
              Mereles's software design course. It allows Vassar students to
              create listings for trips, specifying their role (driver or
              passenger), trip time and date, pick-up and drop-off locations,
              and contact information. These listings are displayed on a
              dashboard accessible to all users, who can filter them by date,
              start and end locations, available seats, and role. Users can
              click on a listing to view detailed information. (This app is not
              published yet.)
